Sanders not pandering to Israel.  Especially right before the New York primary.  Whether you agree with him or not, it was courageous.	positive	
Hillary voter here.Israel: Took some real chutzpah to talk about Israel like that in NYC. Props to Bernie for sticking to his principles.Tax Returns: Good of him to give a definite deadline.Snark: He had some real sass in this debate. I can always appreciate good snark when I hear it.	positive	
Sanders supporter here: I liked Clinton's stance on the minimum wage more than Sanders'.  The minimum wage should go up, but I do think $15 federally would hurt employment in rural areas where money goes further and $12 is livable.	positive	
I kinda understood what she was saying. It sounds like they are basically in agreement, except Clinton wants to get the $12 because it is faster and easier and then try for $15 later.Do you think the general public understood what she was saying?	positive	
I also am a Sanders supporter but I think she's right on minimum wage (at the moment) but I don't think she did a good job of explaining it last night. If I hadn't read her position on her website before I imagine I would have been really confused. I also think she's trying to hard to seem part of the Fight for 15 movement... She should just state her disagreement. But she would likely lose some votes. 	negative	
I'm glad she clarified, it'd been a big issue for me hearing her claim she had always been for the $15/hr minimum wage when I had watched her argue for $12 previously. It makes a lot more sense to set a national minimum at $12 and encourage states and cities that can and should have a higher minimum to go higher. I'm all for a higher minimum wage and I'm just glad the democrats are arguing about whether to raise it 60% or slightly over 100%.	positive	
I was definitely confused.  As far as I could tell, she said "I've always supported $15" and then said "I'd like $12."  That being said, I think $12 makes more sense than $15.  It's not the number that turned me off - it was my perception that she wasn't really saying what she meant and was instead just pandering.	negative	
Hopefully more attention will be given to it. I'm a Bernie supporter, but I've been a bit hesitant on the idea of jumping to a $15/hr minimum wage relatively quickly (compared to the history of wage raises). Hillary's $12/hr with encouragement to go above and beyond absolutely sounds more achievable and I imagine would set the groundwork for more timely, appropriate changes moving alongside inflation in the future.	positive	
Unrelated and this will probably get buried, but thank you for this post. It feels like the first one in a while where both sides are talking positively and constructively rather than ripping each other to shreds. 	positive	
Thank you for your kind words. I feel very optimistic about the Democratic party after last night's debate. One one side we have a battle-hardened, crafty incrementalist who can, at the very least, defend some of the gains made by the Obama administration. On the other side we have a fiery champion of the people who can never be bought by special interests.It would be so wonderful when the two of them join forces. Imagine a dream team of Hillary, Bill, Bernie, and Obama.... With some of them in the White House, and others going out across America to drum up excitement about bringing more equality and opportunity to our great nation.That debate made me proud to be ~~a Democrat~~ an American.	positive	
Yeah, with all of my problems with Sec. Clinton this election season, it's amazing how much better the Democratic side is. 	positive	
I'm a Sanders supporter and will be voting for him on Tuesday, but I'm also a fan of Hillary overall; just less enthusiastically so. What I appreciated about Hillary the most during this debate was her patient demeanor even when the pro-Bernie crowd in the audience was doing its thing and drowning her out. In those moments, she came across as the only grown-up in the room. 	positive	
I second this. Not only did she come off as patient, but she also appeared to be amused, without looking like she was smug or exasperated. 	positive	
Sanders sounded way more comfortable discussing foreign policy than usual, though it probably helped that apparently "foreign policy" now means "Israel-Palestine".  And I liked him hammering her on a carbon tax - probably the only part of Sanders platform that I really think is good.  My view of him improved a fair amount after this debate.	positive	
I am a bit concerned why Sanders supports a carbon tax but not a gas tax increase. For one, other democratic socialist countries have a high gas tax. Also, a carbon tax will effect more industries and markets than a gas tax will. 	negative	
The same reason he thinks the payroll tax won't fall to employees. Because companies will accept a tax and totally not pass it on.	negative	
Yeah I was really surprised that Hillary was willing to endorse a $15 minimum wage, but not a carbon tax.  As far as mainstream liberal economists go, a carbon tax is almost universally considered a positive while a national $15 minimum wage is on shaky ground.	negative	
I think it's been one of his campaign's more disingenuous attacks against Clinton when he calls her a hypocrite for fighting for (and getting) a $15 minimum wage in NYC, but not at the federal level.  If your worldview is so black-and-white that you can't even understand that there is a difference in cost of living between New York City and Texarkana, it casts more of a bad light on you than your opponent.	negative	
This was my favorite part of the debate.  Just hearing two politicians on a national stage battling over the path to sustainable energy was a big deal, IMO.As someone who has been passionately on the front lines of environmentalism my whole life, I think Hillary had the more coherent proposal for a path to a sustainable energy economy.  She spelled out what unbiased experts have been advocating for for a while: Using natural gas to transition to renewables.  It's honestly the plan that is most likely to actually work.Sanders parroted the "Fracking Bad" attitude that has been popular among young environmentalists, but he failed to articulate a real path to sustainability like she did.  This was just another example, to me, of how Bernie seems to be superficially educated about issues.  He can parrot the talking points of his camp, but he can't defend them very well.  Which is sad, because there is a *lot* of stuff about the fracking industry that needs to be addressed.My issue with the hardline stance against fracking is that in order for us to see any real change in our political environment, we *have* to bring the energy sector to the table.  Fracking can be done a *lot* more responsibly than it is now.  I think the best path to sustainables is to exploit our natural gas reserves as safely as we can while developing our solar, wind, geothermal, etc. infrastructure.	positive	
My biggest problem with Sanders over the whole night was with the energy discussion.  It seemed like he was just hitting Hillary over and over with the incrementalism == bad comments (incrementalism isn't enough, never incrementalism when it comes to global warming,  imminent threat that has to be responded to immediately rather than incrementally) but then when pressed on the point that his proposals to end nuclear and natural gas would result in more coal usage to meet energy demands, he came out with "Well, you don't just switch everything overnight."  It made me much more confident in my assumption that he has nothing beyond talking points when it comes to meeting energy demands in an environmentally sustainable way.  	negative	
> over the path to sustainable energy was a big deal, IMOThat was **awesome**.>Hillary: "I will build 20 million solar panels!">Bernie: " I WILL BUILD 500 MILLION SOLAR PANELS!">Hillary: "I WILL BUILD SO MANY PANELS THAT THE LIGHT WILL PIERCE THE HEAVENS!"Or that's how I recalled it. 	positive	
That pro-Palestinian thing was an act of real courage, you rarely hear American politicians do that, and to my mind its very welcome. You other may disagree with the stance, but it shows real principle.On Hillary's side, she's always very strong on foreign policy, and she showed her expertise well. Her defense of NATO, while it may appear weak (I doubt the whole, "I want them to pay more, but don't have anyway to get them to pay answer probably won't win over any voters") but its still to my mind is definitively the correct answer. It would be nice if they paid more but NATO is one of the most powerful and successful military alliances in history. We can't just walk away from it.	positive	
He basically said that the well-being of the Palestinian people needs to come to forefront of the discussion, and that we have to stop putting Israel and Netanyahu beyond reproach.Not that crazy a thing to say, but in the context of US politics, especially in New York, it took a lot of political courage to make that the focal point of his debate answers.	negative	
I'm confused as to how that's perceived as brave, Obama has been reproaching Netanyahu and Israel since day 1. 	negative	
Hillary hasn't, and she even criticises Obama for doing that.https://theintercept.com/2016/02/18/hillary-clinton-with-little-notice-vows-to-embrace-an-extremist-agenda-on-israel/http://time.com/4265947/hillary-clinton-aipac-speech-transcript/> And let me be clear — I would vigorously oppose any attempt by outside parties to impose a solution, including by the U.N. Security Council.	negative	
> Her defense of NATOI liked that she gave a definite answer of "no I will not leave NATO." It provides a strong contrast against Trump who thinks everything is negotiable.	negative	
Trump never said he wants to leave NATO. He said that they need to reproach what NATO is, as the world has changed quite a bit since the Cold War, and that it's goals and operation should reflect the new age. 	negative	
If leaving NATO is not an option for Trump either, then what leverage does he have to get NATO members to contribute more?	negative	
Do you threaten your boss that you're going to leave when you ask for a raise? You don't have to threaten to withdraw to make changes. 	negative	
> Do you threaten your boss that you're going to leave when you ask for a raise? Implicitly, yeah, you kinda do.  It's not smart to *say* you're going to quit if they say no (unless you are literally ready to do that because you have another offer or whatever), but the unspoken implication is that you might or at least might seek other opportunities if you don't get what you want.	negative	
But that's basically how Trump describes his negotiation tactics for getting Mexico to pay for the wall. He threatens protectionist tariffs that would hurt Mexico's economy.	negative	
Well that is a negotiating chip, for sure, but it doesn't have to be used. Trump isn't building that fucking wall btw, it's just not happenign, it's all rhetoric. But yeah, we can go to NATO and say hey, We are doing things this way now, and you have to pay this much. Then begin negotiating. 	positive
>Well that is a negotiating chip, for sure, but it doesn't have to be usedThat's the difference I think between Clinton and Trump. Clinton would take that chip off the table. Trump would not. 	negative	
So, let's say we agree that NATO needs reforming. What is Hillary going to do? She's just going to say, "Well we asked them and they didn't agree. So same thing as usual; no change here." The chip has to be on the table, even if it's never intended to be used. Politics is all a form of poker. 	negative	
I really liked Sanders' Israel answer. It sums up my position pretty succinctly. 	positive	
Sanders supporter here:1. While I take displays of emotion with a grain of salt, when it comes to politicians, Secretary Clinton looked genuinely angry when she was talking about the effects of gun violence. I appreciate that. Which leads me to #2.2. Even though I absolutely understand Sander's defense of his vote concerning gun law and do not appreciate the attempts to tie him to the NRA, I still like Clinton's stance on gun law more. My views on guns also do not align with the constitution, so take that as you will.	positive	
Clinton is not going to follow through with her current position in the general election. She'll move back to the center on guns. 	negative	
Sander's stance on Israel really was brave and courageous.  It was one of the first candid deconstructions of US-Israeli politics that I've ever seen on a national stage like that.	positive	
Hillary is clearly a very skilled debater, able to clearly articulate her points.	positive	
True. But sometimes she kinda talks herself into a circle and I'm like "wtf did she just say?"Not accepting *any* responsibility as Secretary of State was a turn off for me. I mean, we get it, Obama makes the final call. But you're his top foreign policy advisor. Surely you deserve some blame. Everyone knows the Middle East is a clusterfuck, accepting some responsibility for that will actually make people (me) respect you more. 	negative	
My mum said the same thing last night. She doesn't really follow politics like I do and she sat down to watch the debate and after one of Clintons answers on Israel I think she just went 'she talked for 2 minutes but didn't really say anything' 	negative	
Yeah that was the part that really irritated me. She's constantly claimed credit for the foreign policy accomplishments of the Obama administration but whenever a blunder is pointed to she says it was OBama's call. I'm also generally getting tired of hearing Obama's name all the time coming from Clinton in these debates. It's a political tactic which works, but it's just getting annoying. 	negative	
I think it's hard for her when all Bernie does is sit in the backseat and criticize every foreign policy move ever as if he'd do a better job with zero experience. It's really easy to be Captain Hindsight.	negative	
I liked Sanders stance on Israel. Mainly because I don't like bending over backwards for Israel.I also think he did a much better job on foreign policy.	positive	
I mean, I can kind of understand if they asked "How would you respond to criticisms from the Sandy Hook victims?"That's still kind of loaded, but at least it is asking for a policy response.But their was question was literally "Will you apologize?" without asking for policy or context. Like 99.99% of politicians will just reflexively apologize because who would say "no" to parents of dead kids. Pros to Bernie standing firm.	positive	
That's one thing that bugs me. They keep talking about gun manufacturers being the only businesses that have "special protections." but that's not the case at all. Clinton even asked "show me one other business that has this kind of protection."It's not a special protection given only to gun manufacturers, it's actually the opposite. It's that they want to be able to sue the gun manufacturers for something that no other manufacturers are held liable for - misuse of a product.There isn't a company in the US that can be sued for accident or injury caused by misuse of the product, only for manufacturing or design defects in the product itself.It's why you can't sue Ford when you are hit by a drunk driver or a knife manufacturer when you accidentally cut your finger off. You can't sue a shampoo producer if you get poisoned from drinking shampoo and you can't sue a baseball bat manufacturer because the mugger that attacked you hit you with it.You can absolutely sue a gun manufacturer if the gun has a defect and explodes or has some other dangerous manufacturing or design flaw.So why should a special liability be applied to gun manufacturers that does not apply to any other manufacturer or industry?edit: Yes, I do understand that you *can* sue since you can pretty much sue for anything, but you can't necessarily *successfully* sue, which was the (I thought implied) intent of my statement to begin with.	positive	
You certainly can sue Ford for that, and you will lose. Because the judicial system will determine it to be either frivolous or the case will proceed and you'll get hammered. That's the job of the judicial branch. What Bernie is suggesting is making it *impossible* to sue gun manufacturers. He's suggesting that the legislative make a power grab from the judicial just for this one industry. That's not how the system was set up, each branch of government has a specialty and they are supposed to check and balance each other. Not randomly usurp power in favor of certain private industries. 	negative	
>“I think the secretary has confused a lot of people.”Sanders handled minimum wage well, with this being a very good line.  Clinton's nuanced delivery style often makes people feel like she's trying to bamboozle or schmooze something past them, so this is a subtle play on that feeling.>“It’s easy to diagnose the problem. It’s harder to do something about the problem.”Clinton found a good line that easily explains why voters should choose her over Sanders considering she runs into issues conveying complex ideas in easily digestible bites.	positive	
>Clinton found a good line that easily explains why voters should choose herYeah. She should really use that to frame future debates, perhaps from the opening statement.	positive	
Sanders2016:The WebMD of Politics	negative	
Sanders sounded competent on foreign policy, as compared to previous debates where I literally cringed during his foreign policy answers.	positive	
Some of his answers were still cringeworthy.  Especially on Libya.>I voted to support democracy in Libya.  Ok great>That didn't mean I was for regime change.When you voted that the US should go to the UN to advocate democracy in Libya did you think that plan included leaving a genocidal dictator in charge?  How can you vote for democracy and then criticize Hillary/Obama for actually taking the steps to try to implement democracy?You either support letting them have democracy or you oppose regime change.  You can't have both.  Democracy means removing the regime, and leaving the regime in place means no democracy.	negative	
and then he turns around and criticizes clinton for doing the same thing with bush	negative	
But the resolution said that we could use military force to protect civilians. That's exactly what we did. Bernie Sanders has a pattern of wanting to have cake and eat it too. This is especially evident with foreign policy and with Libya. You either do what we did (protect the people and allow regime change) or you let the civilians die. Sanders voted to protect the people. His whole argument about Clinton being pro regime change is complete bullshit. Besides, if we hadn't intervened in Libya, France and the UK would have done it without us and we would have looked shitty not helping them when they help us all the time. 	negative	
He was a little more coherent than he's ever been, but Hillary really demonstrated her expertise on the issue during this debate, I think.  At the same time, she also revealed her old-guard pro-Israel bias when the topic came up, and he walked all over her on that issue.Even still, I didn't see anything that contradicted the mainstream narrative that Hillary is stronger on foreign policy than Sanders overall.  She clearly has a nuanced and detailed understanding of global politics, and he's clearly a noob in that regard.	positive	
I think that Hillary really highlighted that difference when Bernie said that he had spent a few months in Israel and Hillary responded that she brokered a cease-fire there.  I give Sanders credit for maintaining his argument that we need to be more pro-Palestine in our stances there, but I disagree that being more pro-Palestine means that we have to be more anti-Israel.	positive	
Sanders supporter here.I am always impressed with Clinton's grasp of and ability to understand policy nuance and get into the details of everything. Unfortunately, I think this keeps her bogged down sometimes, but, at the same time, I think it is one of the reasons that she is so pragmatic and has fairly reasonable goals.Edit: I wanted to add that when Clinton is considering the details and ramifications of different policies, it often appears that she is trying to waffle and pander to every voter bloc at once. I don't think she is intentionally pandering to everyone at once, but, rather, is aware that giving a definite "yes" or "no" answer is very difficult.Edit #2: I think this is a good example of her getting caught up in details that, while very important, can take away from the bigger picture. [This is from the debate last night while the candidates were discussing health care and education.](https://youtu.be/KunPfHnefiw?t=1h39m41s) First, this is a topic that Clinton knows a lot about and has worked with healthcare for a long time. At the same time though, Sanders has a big bold message that people gravitate towards. Second, the moderators have to start cutting her off when she starts discussing the costs and specific analyses of universal healthcare. She even calls it the fine print of Sander's plan. You can see Sander's response is quick, broad, and very appealing.	positive	
I'm glad Hillary brought up the lack of questions about women's reproductive rights. While we can all pretty much guess where they'll both stand, it's a major issue in the US and should be addressed at some point.I will say I was disappointed that no one brought up LGBT issues. Again, the answers are probably predictable, but given the flak Hillary's taken for changing her stance on the marriage issue, it would have been good to give her a chance to engage that topic.	positive	
I am democrat, but not really a Bernie Supporter or Clinton Supporter.Clinton - the depth of her knowledge on policy.  She has nuanced answers on most topics.  Bernie - he has had the same opinions for 30 years.  I was a Vermonter in the 80/90s and he hasn't changed much since then.  Just watched a documentary on Ronald Reagan and both candidates could REALLY learn a lot from Reagan on controlling & using their body language.  Sanders pointing and Clinton smirking was a little off putting	negative	
I didn't get to hear the whole debate and when I had it on wasnt paying very close attention, but I would say Hillarys closing statement was very eloquent and well done.  I know that's not a very substantive observation, but it's rare in election debates to hear eloquence.	positive	
Clinton supporter.I was impressed by Sanders' savvy political play in the minimum wage portion of the debate. He latched on to Clinton saying she supported the Fight For 15 in LA and New York, and put her on the defensive by speaking as though she said she supported a national $15/hr wage. While she did clarify later in the exchange that she was still in favor of a $12 national minimum, he'd already gotten the better of her and put her on the defensive. She's going to come out of that exchange looking inconsistent. Very smart political play.	positive	
Man I found that bit to be super frustrating as a Clinton Supporter.  His theatrics were ridiculous.  	negative	
Sanders definitely won this exchange. He even made me think Clinton was flip-flopping when she didn't ever do any such thing.It's definitely a different tactic to attack a person for not supporting something they support. It seems to be working.	positive	
I think overall I was impressed with how Hillary went after Bernie on his inconsistencies. When Bernie was asked to give an example of one decision that Hillary made as senator that showed she favored banks because of the money she received, he didn't give anything that was close to an answer. It was one of the weakest responses of the night. And while I agree with Bernie that the banks should be broken up, I don't think attacking Hillary is the way to wake America up on this issue. What he should be saying is that super-PACs and money from Wall Street is corruptible to ALL. Whether or not Hillary is guilty of taking money from Wall Street in exchange for favors is irrelevant. Because not only has he been unable to prove that it's influenced her policy-making, but it's also  distracting the voters to what the real issue is. Everybody has become so anti-Hillary, they've made her the single root of all corruption. But it's just speculation and assumption over facts. We should be taking on the system, not one single individual who may or may not be guilty. Bernie needs to hit on the bigger picture more aggressively: that Super-PACs have opened the floodgates to corruption. So if it hasn't happened to Hillary Clinton, it's going to happen to SOMEBODY. The fact that super-PACs exist damages our democracy. And that's what he should be preaching to America. And I know this is a presidential race, so it's easy for Bernie to make Hillary his punching bag on this issue, but she is just too ferocious of a debater and she proved that last night.	negative	
Clinton made some great talking points in the debate. Her best one was probably in regards to banking and splitting up the banks. Bernie didn't have a good answer for it. I loved Sanders comment about Supreme Court Justice. Clinton just lost any remaining respect I had for her on this issue. First the moderators ask her if she supports the Obama nomination and just to look like a Obama supporter she says yes. Question goes to Sanders and he says no because the person being nominated has never said whether or not he supports citizens united. Crowd starts cheering for the answer and you immediately hear Clinton try to go in and agree with this view point (pro choice, lgbt, etc) and add extra comments. So does this mean she supports the nomination or no? Her flip flop on issues is insane and thats where voters feel uneasy about voting for her. 	negative	
I think Hillary did well for talking about Obama a LOT in the debate. Which is important as Obama is undoubtedly loved in New York.	positive	
The thing that annoys me is how she takes credit for obamas successes as she was a cabinet member but she supposedly had nothing to do with his drawbacks	negative	
It's perfectly legitimate to point out that many of Bernie's criticisms of Hillary also apply to Obama. It puts those criticisms into perspective. When Bernie claims that Hillary's donations from Wall Street will prevent her from effectively regulating them, it's fair to note that Obama's donations from Wall Street didn't stop him from signing Dodd-Frank.	negative	
Clinton supporter: **Israel**. I liked how he was willing to honestly criticize a US ally. Too often, great powers are blackmailed by erratic allies (NK-China, Pakistan-US), and being willing to draw a line around Netanyahu implies that maybe he's better at foreign policy than he lets on.	positive	
He did the same thing with Sandy Hook a few debates ago. He was right about not suing gun manufacturers but he paid for it politically. You have to admire the guy for being principled. 	positive	
I thought her closing statement sounded great, heartfelt and sincere. But yes, this sub is 80% Clinton supporters. 	positive	
I was honestly impressed that Sanders stuck to his belief about Palestine, even if I (and likely many others) don't agree with him. Takes courage to take a politically unpopular opinion and defend it in a national debate.	positive	
I was pretty busy during the debate (will be playing it on my way to work) so I really was not able to pick up on many of the nuances, although it seemed as if Bernie had a very strong performance, which I am impressed with.  He clearly got some advice on how to better corner Clinton on certain issues and make her stumble or come out for the program/initiative.	positive	
Bernie knows how to stay on point	positive	
Sanders has stopped impressing me because he never gets beyond the same stump speech he's been using for years. Clinton impresses me because she has a better grasp on the details of Sanders' record than Sanders does himself. Though sadly, Clinton also impresses me (in a bad way) with her brazen attacks that take certain facts of Bernie's record *way* out of context.>Not Dodging Questions: I thought the question about "would you apologize to Sandy Hook victims?" was a super loaded and unfair question. But Bernie took it head on, and answered it clearly and straightforwardly. Again, that took a lot of political courage.That one particular moment was impressive on Bernie's part, ditto his answer on Palestine, but he dodged plenty more earlier in the night, e.g. after insinuating time and time again about Clinton being bought by special interests, he couldn't name a *single example* of her changing position because of it. He just did the usual pivot into his stump speech. It was too evocative of his lack of details in the NY Daily News interview. And his broadside attack on Clinton's minimum wage position was ridiculous. It's too often the case in this campaign that Bernie paints in broad strokes whereas Clinton prefers nuance: Clinton never *opposed* a $15 minimum wage, as long as it was limited to certain localities. The NY law recently passed will scale slower in poorer rural areas, so it doesn't shock their economy. That's EXACTLY the policy Clinton has been proposing all along, and Bernie was outright wrong to accuse her of changing positions. It's such politics-as-usual bullshit from a man who's supposed to be the most genuine guy in the campaign.And the crime bill! Yes, Clinton supported it, but Bernie *voted for it!* Why is she the only one who has to bear the burden? And he feigns such anger over her unreleased transcripts, but where the hell are his tax returns? We've 20 years worth of Clinton's, but not even one full years worth of Bernie's. It's hypocritical to pose as a champion of transparency when you're hiding like that.But I admit I'm giving Bernie a harder time *because* he's supposed to be the *genuine* candidate. Clinton was never a stranger to distortions, e.g. the 'guns out of state per capita' remark over Vermont. I guess there's a principled point somewhere in there about how gun laws in certain states affect others ones, but it sure makes it sound like she's trying to force Bernie to bear a larger part of the burden than he's actually due. It's a crappy point, and only serves to make her look bad. I realize I just defeated the spirit of this thread, but this debate really riled me up. I just want this contest to be over already so we can get to the good fight come fall. 	negative
