It was basically Sanders' first experience with the equivalent of attack ads, and it did not end well for him. In bizarro-world where he wins the nomination, those mumbles, errms and outright "I don't know"s would haunt him until he lost.	negative

For all the crap that Hillary has gotten over her corporate connections, it's these insights that really drives home that value for a President. She has the power and the connections to call up the leader of a major company to get their insights on the issues that are influencing capitalism. She then has the intelligence and experience to propose policies to amend them. Most importantly, she has the open-mindedness to listen. It's the last quality that I am most uncertain about in Bernie. I don't know if he would listen to the leaders of corporations he is so passionately crusading against. And that makes it harder for him to propose and enact policies that will actually help.	positive

" Daily News: There are many who believe that the stimulus program that had a lot of infrastructure money was divided up politically.Clinton: Well, look. Politics has to play some role in this. Let's not forget we do have to play some role. I got to get it passed through Congress. And I think I'm well-prepared to do that. I was telling you about Buffalo. I got $20 million. Now I got that because it was political. But it worked.

I think that the questions appear "softball" compared to Sanders because she answered them pretty clearly the first time.

This sums up the reason for my support pretty well: > You see, I really believe that one of the challenges is we're locked in this ideological binary world right now where you've got the Tea Party ideologues, which are basically determining what Republicans say, taking a negative stand toward everything. “Government can't do anything and we shouldn't even pretend that it can.” And then you've got the people who say “the government's got the answer to everything. Whatever is ailing you, we got to get the government back doing all these things.” Look, I think you've got to say, "Hey, what are the goals we're setting? What are the steps we take?" It sounds boring but this is the kind of strategic analysis and presentation I believe in, and, "How are we going to accomplish it?" And then you look at that map and you say, "Where do I need to get the support? Where do I go to make the case?"I want good, effective governance, not just government or the lack thereof for its own sake.	positive

Loved her comments on technical training as a means of mitigating the loss of manufacturing jobs, re-training is a great way to increase employment flexibility and help rescue those hurt by jobs moving overseas.As always, extremely nuanced and well researched positions on everything brought up in the interview. I thought her contextualization for the 1994 Crime Bill was adequate for addressing the drawbacks (but I'm also fitting it into more that I've read on the subject, not just this interview).As a moderate Dem (and thus, de facto Clinton supporter), I loved everything she had to say [but that's also because she didn't talk about the death penalty or drug law].	positive

They only seem that way because she was prepared with real answers.

I don't know why some people don't get this. Basically every interview that the candidates give are like job interviews, and they need to prepare for all possibilities.

This interview was very good for Hillary. I don't know how someone is so knowledgeable about every aspect of most issues. Nuance answers don't explain this women, she is her very own policy advisor. Usually most politicians, including cerebral people like Obama, need in-depth briefings on both domestic and foreign policy, but from what I've read from her policy advisors she knows about as much as them and asks really esoteric questions. Maybe she should copy Trump by saying she's her best advisor because she has a "good brain." Edit: use of scary was confusing	positive	
	hillary	
I'm certainly biased but she strikes me as remarkably intelligent. Like, scary smart.Which is why I think sometime people find her "inauthentic" - she doesn't wanna give some stump speech filled with one liners. She wants *this* type of setting.	positive	
	hillary	
She's trapped between a rock and a hard place when she stumps -- on the one hand, she knows the facts inside out better than anybody and really shines in that department. On the other hand, if she delves even remotely into the details everyone tunes out and she loses her audience. so she's stuck on that podium rattling off platitudes bored out of her mind. it's probably similar to asking an astrophysicist to ELI5 stars -- i'm surprised she hasn't developed some sort of drinking problem on the campaign trail. 	positive

It's pretty much what everyone from Rubio to Obama has agreed.

I think given the current state of the house and Senate the potential for significant change is next to zero. I like Bernie and voted for him at my caucus mainly because I like the message that be is propagating throughout our politics.That being said I think all of his more radical ideas wouldn't make it out of committee. Look what they did to Obama's plans, can you imagine what they'd do to someone even more progressive?We need the people who supported Sanders to be as active or even more active during midterms when turn it's are terrible. Those are the decision makers. Even local and state elections are important. Partly because it's your community, and almost more importantly those are the people that end up running for federal seats.I think the one saving grace for Hilary is she knows the current politics really well and can work both sides a bit more hopefully. I see her being at least a little support from the right. I see Bernie getting none. Same with Trump. His own party won't help him and most things.	positive

I think this goes beyond inexperience/experience.  Sanders has been in congress for decades and a politician for longer than that.  He is experienced, or at least has had the opportunity to become experienced.This is more a pragmatic/not pragmatic divide.  Clinton is intensely pragmatic.  She sees what she wants done and she studies the hell out of the problems history and details a plan to deal with it including every kind of factor you can think of.   Sanders is not pragmatic.  He sees a problem and he protests it.  He passes judgement on other people's plans for fixing the problem, but doesn't work out the details of his own plans.  And that's why he came off so terrible.I just don't see how Sanders has the potential for significant change if he can't even articulate a path to achieving the change he wants.	negative	
	bernie	
That's definitely the group he is trying to appeal to.  I just don't see how being inexperienced is actually an asset in achieving it.Being Secretary of State definitely helps with the foreign policy, but as  a Senator, Sanders has been on many committees, passed tons of amendments, and voted on many bills.  He should at least have the knowledge and experience in those areas to be able to articulate how he will achieve the change he wants.  Otherwise it's like the person who claims they are going to go out and get a job, but ends up spending all day on the internet complaining about the job market instead.	positive	
	bernie	
Sanders' tenure in the Senate is what made his NYDN so embarrassing. He's been inside the beltway fighting for financial policy for decades, and yet still appeared unsure of what the Fed does. And he definitely seems unclear of what an investment bank does or how much "too big to fail" had to do with leverage instead of institutional diversification. 	negative	
	bernie	
I agree. I was particularly impressed by the way she described her thought process in approaching infrastructure spending. She seems like the kind of person who I like working with in my professional life. She identifies a problem, figures out what success looks like, puts all options on the table on how to achieve it, and takes it step by step. > I think you've got to say, "Hey, what are the goals we're setting? What are the steps we take?" It sounds boring but this is the kind of strategic analysis and presentation I believe in, and, "How are we going to accomplish it?" And then you look at that map and you say, "Where do I need to get the support? Where do I go to make the case?"> So I think we can do that, and particularly if we can get the mechanism for the National Infrastructure Bank. Because if all we do is rely on Congress, then we are going to be at their mercy every five to seven to eight years. Whereas if we say, yeah, Congress still has the primary role... It passed finally $275 billion program, but we want to have an ongoing, revolving fund. We need to look at how we can once again use municipal bonding authority. How can we use more state bonding authority? We used for a little period of time, and I like the idea of federal bonds that can be used for infrastructure, as long as you have a revenue stream.	positive

> The difference is if you want someone who can do all of that but holds different views than you.I don't agree with Hillary on everything, and hate money in politics too.  But electability is a gigantic factor too.  And yes, she is abundantly qualified."Agreeing most" with a candidate is WAY overrated, I think.  Because of the first-past-the-post system we have (like it, or hate it), **electability** is really THE most important issue there is.  Who on my side can best win over whomever they nominate on their side.Yes, of course that requires one to compromise on some things.  Fortunately the things I don't like about Hillary aren't complete deal-breakers for me (they're things I dislike about practically ALL politicians, even the ones I do like).8 years ago I matched the most closely with Dennis Kucinich, but I'll be damned if I was going to volunteer for him, or donate money.  He didn't stand a chance in hell of winning, and couldn't have enacted much of his agenda even if he had somehow gotten into office.There are a certain range of possible outcomes that are -- well, **possible** (i.e. *politically* possible).  YES, moneyed interests have WAY too much influence, but wanting it to be otherwise isn't going to change that in the short term.Hillary will make a relatively good president, probably as good as any I've seen in my lifetime (or at least nearly so) -- and I'm pushing 50.  And as far as being "qualified" - she's as qualified as any candidate I can ever personally remember running. 	positive

I fucking love NYDN's interviews. Maybe I'm ignorant, but why haven't I heard more about NYDN before this election cycle? They ask some very pointed, substantive questions.This is a great interview from Clinton. She gave thoughtful, thorough, responsive answers and talked very specifically about her ideas and what she's done in the past. *This* is the Hillary Clinton I don't think enough people get to hear from. We're so used to just hearing candidates giving sound bite-laden campaign speeches or trading headline-friendly debate barbs. It's not often enough we have interviews or opportunities to really hear a candidate talk about *specifics* free of the pressure to deliver rehearsed platitudes.When Clinton is in *that* environment (you know, the environment an actual President is in all the time), she absolutely  thrives. If she's on the stump or at a debate, she holds her own well enough but I still feel like it's foreign to her. Clinton is at her best in this format and is a much better policy maker/politician/decision maker than she is a candidate.	positive

It's easy to do a comparison. Bernie on big banks:>Daily News: Okay. Well, let's assume that you're correct on that point. How do you go about doing it?>Sanders: How you go about doing it is having legislation passed, or giving the authority to the secretary of treasury to determine, under Dodd-Frank, that these banks are a danger to the economy over the problem of too-big-to-fail.>Daily News: But do you think that the Fed, now, has that authority?>Sanders: Well, I don't know if the Fed has it. But I think the administration can have it.>Daily News: How? How does a President turn to JPMorgan Chase, or have the Treasury turn to any of those banks and say, "Now you must do X, Y and Z?">Sanders: Well, you do have authority under the Dodd-Frank legislation to do that, make that determination.>Daily News: You do, just by Federal Reserve fiat, you do?>Sanders: Yeah. Well, I believe you do.>Daily News: So if you look forward, a year, maybe two years, right now you have...JPMorgan has 241,000 employees. About 20,000 of them in New York. $192 billion in net assets. What happens? What do you foresee? What is JPMorgan in year two of...>Sanders: What I foresee is a stronger national economy. And, in fact, a stronger economy in New York State, as well. What I foresee is a financial system which actually makes affordable loans to small and medium-size businesses. Does not live as an island onto themselves concerned about their own profits. And, in fact, creating incredibly complicated financial tools, which have led us into the worst economic recession in the modern history of the United States.>Daily News: I get that point. I'm just looking at the method because, actions have reactions, right? There are pluses and minuses. So, if you push here, you may get an unintended consequence that you don't understand. So, what I'm asking is, how can we understand? If you look at JPMorgan just as an example, or you can do Citibank, or Bank of America. What would it be? What would that institution be? Would there be a consumer bank? Where would the investing go?>Sanders: I'm not running JPMorgan Chase or Citibank.>Daily News: No. But you'd be breaking it up.>Sanders: That's right. And that is their decision as to what they want to do and how they want to reconfigure themselves. That's not my decision. All I am saying is that I do not want to see this country be in a position where it was in 2008, where we have to bail them out. And, in addition, I oppose that kind of concentration of ownership entirely.>You're asking a question, which is a fair question. But let me just take your question and take it to another issue. Alright? It would be fair for you to say, "Well, Bernie, you got on there that you are strongly concerned about climate change and that we have to transform our energy system away from fossil fuel. What happens to the people in the fossil fuel industry?">That's a fair question. But the other part of that is if we do not address that issue the planet we’re gonna leave your kids and your grandchildren may not be a particularly healthy or habitable one. So I can't say, if you're saying that we’re going to break up the banks, will it have a negative consequence on some people? I suspect that it will. Will it have a positive impact on the economy in general? Yes, I think it will.And now with Clinton:>Daily News: Wall Street, too big to fail.>Clinton: Too big to fail.>Daily News: How do you stop too big to fail? What needs to happen?>Clinton: Well, I have been a strong supporter of Dodd-Frank because it is the most consequential financial reforms since the Great Depression. And I have said many times in debates and in other settings, there is authority in Dodd-Frank to break up banks that pose a grave threat to financial stability.>There are two approaches. There's Section 121, Section 165, and both of them can be used by regulators to either require a bank to sell off businesses, lines of businesses or assets, because of the finding that is made by two-thirds of the financial regulators that the institution poses a grave threat, or if the Fed and the FDIC conclude that the institutions' living will resolution is inadequate and is not going to get any better, there can also be requirements that they do so.>So we've got that structure. Now a lot of people have argued that there need to be some tweaks to it that I would be certainly open to. But my point from the very beginning of this campaign, and it's something that I've said repeatedly: big banks did not cause the Great Recession primarily. They were complicit, but hedge funds; Lehman Brothers, an investment bank; a big insurance company, AIG; mortgage companies like Countrywide, Fannie and Freddie — there were lots of culprits who were contributing to the circumstances that led to the very dangerous financial crisis.It seems fairly clear that one of them has a stronger grasp on the details than the other. Clinton has always been particularly good about specifics, whereas Sanders paints in broad strokes.But will it have an impact on the primaries? I'm not so sure. I think most people have decided at this point, and also that most people vote based on perception rather than intellectual rigor. Clinton may be the clear wonk, but anyone choosing Sanders likely believes him to be the more sincere candidate, if not the most studied one. So I think this interview will only reinforce Clinton voters, rather than bring over new ones. It seems certain that the demographic trends of the last couple of months will be maintained throughout the rest of the nominating contests. The goal now is to *avoid messing up,* and in that respect, Clinton has performed well in this interview.	positive

Night and day difference from Bernie's interview.  HRC has specifics.  She addresses motivation with regards to the increase in college tuition and how she thinks the government can stop in and incentivize colleges to lower costs.  I also think fundamentally the idea that college would be free is silly.  Asking parents to chip in as they are able and kids to work 10 hours/week is a very reasonable alternative to confiscatory tax rates funding someone else's kid's tuition.I also think she addressed the lack of prosecutions with regards to Wall Street in a fact based manner.  Bernie loves to demagogue and throw verbal bombs, but anyone with common sense would tell you if ambitious Justice Dept. attorneys could make a case for fraud they would absolutely do so.  Many activities we didn't like on Wall St. were simply legal, if unethical.  The laws are the problem...not the integrity of our Justice Dept.  Bernie does the whole country a disservice the way he prattles on about corruption stopping Wall St. prosecutions.	positive

The difference between Clinton and Sanders in their interviews is night and day.

I loved that moment. And then when Clinton said "she" talking about the federal judge struck me as so oddly specific.

There was another time in a debate when they were talking about the minimum wage, and Clinton brought up labor expert Alan Krueger's work in support. O'Malley said something like, "I don't think we should be listening to economists from Wall Street," to which she replied, "He's not Wall Street."And she was right. Krueger is a lifetime academic. So she didn't just know the conclusions of his work, she knew his background as well.	positive

I think Bernie's career-long "outsider" status has hurt him in a way. Hillary has been in the thick of the nitty gritty stuff while Bernie has had the luxury, as an independent, to fight for idealistic things. He's never really had to defend his major policy ideas because until this past year, no one questioned him on it. He just kind of plodded along in Congress where generalities and broad approaches to topics can get you a passing grade in a friendly home state. He did himself a disservice by not nailing down the real world specifics knowing he'd be up against a policy wonk like Clinton. edit: spelling	negative

I'm 25 minutes in and I think Hillary does a great job at giving detail, especially to Americas political history and how they were handled. I feel though as she is giving us the historical information regarding where the issue stemmed from and what she thinks could have been done to stop it. They have gone over 3-5 topics in some way so far but haven't addressed her plans and policies. It's good to know that someone has knowledge on the issue but I think all candidates need to do a better job on giving the solutions. There's much more to go but that's my thoughts so far.	positive

I was fairly turned off after the first question. The 2000 recession after the dotcom bubble burst had very little to do with Federal government policy, and everything to do with a market correction (and probably a market OVER-correction) in response to one of the most transformative economic moments... well, maybe ever, but certainly in a generation.But instead of saying that, she goes out of her way to take a partisan jab at Bush 43.It's OK to admit that a robust economy will have moments of recession. Governments can cushion the blow, but telling your constituents that you can stop economic slowdowns lacks intellectual honesty. In a wonk-ish interview like this, I'd have preferred to see that.	negative

As a Sanders supporter, I am alright with a lot of what Secretary Clinton says, and that hasn't changed here. She is a great speaker and a good politician. However, her Israel policy hasn't changed,  and that's a deal breaker for me. And it leads me to feel like she will be more aggressive military wise than some alternatives. 	negative
