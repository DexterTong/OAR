All of the corpora come from reddit comments on the following subreddits:

/r/sandersforpresident
/r/hillaryclinton
/r/politics
/r/politicaldiscussion
/r/the_donald

A particular thread is hand-picked and then comments are annotated manually. They are rated either negative or positive, or simply discarded.

I've decided for now to skip /r/politics since the comments are pretty low-quality
/r/the_donald is even worse. Sorry Drumpf.
