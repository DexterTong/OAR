Hillary looks like she wants to strangle someone at the end	negative	hillary	
Bernie looks so smug for a moment when the crowds chants keep her from speaking.  It's amazing.	positive	bernie	
Same thing happened last debate. She tried to act like they were clapping for her. I have never seen anything so cringeworthy.	negative	hillary	
She wants to strangle the whole room because she doesn't see her crown.	negative	hillary	
You know, for a while people were tripping over themselves asking Bernie if he would support Hillary if she won the primary.  Did anyone bother to ask Hillary the converse?	negative	hillary	
She doesn't want to imagine the possibility of it. I do imagine she is losing more and more sleep over this every night though.	negative	hillary	
When she picked up her pen and started writing, I imagined her writing something like "I fucking hate this guy."	negative	hillary	
I read it as smug indignation of one who felt assured of ascendancy.> We all know I'm going to win... I just showed up a check the box. Get your Bernie chanting out of your system, it'll be a Hilary White House soon.	negative	hillary	
She basically said as much at the end. It's really cute that all you young'ns support Bernie, but you need to do as you're told and unify the party for the general (paraphrasing).	negative	hillary	
She looked more pissed off than in Miami. Probably because there were name chants AND a standing ovation. The DNC is going to go into overdrive with party affiliation changes now	negative	hillary	
Hello deafening "Bernie"  chants while my time to talk is ticking 	positive	bernie	
Meanwhile Bernie had that "WTF" face whenever Hilary made a terrible argument  	negative	hillary	
He really doesn't hide his emotions. It's quite the contrast to watch them side-by-side during the debate. On our left we have Clinton with the stern yet blank, face hiding all emotion and "controlled" while on the right you could see Bernie's reaction to every response (lie). [The Bernie side-eye was out in full force!]Even her pointing is "controlled" and seemed practiced... like she practiced how to angle her body before the debate to show strength. And ofcourse, the typical politician fist instead of pointing. While Bernie ignores that politicians aren't supposed to "point" and just goes full on finger waving with passion.Their personalities basically come through in their body language.	positive	bernie	
She does snicker a lot though...constant heh..heh..heh. laughing that the mic catches whenever he makes a statement she has exceptionally low regard for.edit: fixed mic typo	negative	hillary	
I suspect Hillary Clinton has been carefully coached on how to present herself, partly because she is a woman and from a time when being a lady in politics put you under a lot of crosshairs. (Or maybe even worse--being a FLOTUS.)The one thing I feel a *little* sorry for Hillary about is that I think this is really a shame--the fact that she's been coached and image-tested and cross-examined by her publicists. I think that she did this to become an effective politician but it has become one of her biggest Achilles' heels. Back when I still read Slate (before this election cycle completely destroyed my good opinion of them) there was a good article about how Hillary Clinton, rather than trying to be *likable* (which she always, ALWAYS fails at) should lean into her more authentic identity as a policy wonk and a obligate politician. I'm not saying I love that Hillary either, because honestly her policy positions are just too morally fluid for my tastes, but I would have liked that Hillary a lot better. At least that's an honest Hillary, a Hillary that is true to herself, which is someone that likes legislating. Maybe someone that doesn't have a cohesive sense of what she *wants* to legislate, but at least there's something to her, personality-wise.	negative	hillary	
> And ofcourse, the typical politician fist instead of pointingThey actually call that the "Clinton thumb"	negative	hillary	
> like she practiced how to angle her body before the debate to show Holy fuck yes I thought I was crazy. She was just standing so unnatural with very robotic and forced arm movements when she tried to put emphasis on certain things. Everything about her is fake	negative	hillary	
>whenever Hillary made a terrible argumentMost of the debate then	negative	hillary	
Oooh no it isn't. I recognize that face she made, it is the one my Grandmother makes when she is about five seconds away from telling everybody in the room to be quiet. Hillary *was* annoyed at the very least, bordering on angry, and I **really** wish the crowd had kept going. That was a couple seconds away from a potentially, extremely powerful moment.	negative	hillary	
Same, my grandmother as well, funnily enough. I hope Bernie wins not just because I like him, but because seeing her snap will be hilarious. Yes, that's petty, I know. Whatever.	positive	bernie	
It might be petty, but a show of genuine anger from her would be the most truthful thing she has done this cycle. I think I would even respect her a little bit more if she showed that she wasn't some robot.	negative	hillary	
Actually it would be a great form of [nonviolent protest](https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/4ee9v4/police_arrest_400_at_us_capitol_in_protest_of/d1zfocu). She doesn't have a right to make the world shut up because it isn't obeying her wishes -- disobeying them in a way that we have the right to do (like chanting "Bernie" and asking about her transcripts) could be a way to get her to take off her mask without doing anything that's actually objectionable.	negative	hillary	
I'm beginning to think about "Hillary gets the last word" is an actual demand that her campaign makes in debate negotiations. It's like every point in every debate that she gets to speak to last. Every opening statement, every closing statement. She always gets the last word.And let's not even get into the vast disparity between speaking times before being interrupted.	negative	hillary	
#JaneSandersForFirstLady2016!!!Seriously though, the Sanders' has to be the most lovable familly ever.	positive	bernie	
Please tell Bernie to get the taxes done with sooner then later. This shouldn't even be an issue for Hilary to fire back with. 	positive	bernie	
Didnt you hear, Hillary is doing so so well, she's def gunna win!  You can tell because she's grasping at straws and chasing shadows.	negative	hillary	
I think Bernie having a Snapchat with little stories snippets would be awesome! 	positive	bernie	
they will smear him for nothing in the taxes and pretend it's something. it's what HRC's paid hatchet people do	negative	hillary	
Kind of a brave move for Hill to show up at a Sanders rally.	negative	hillary	
shes just pandering	negative	hillary	
Well, it's not like they go to her's.	negative	hillary	
Anybody catch the very audible *Sigh* that Hillary's mic caught right before she started talking?That was the single most beautiful moment of the debate for me.	negative	hillary	
She wishes she had that amount of support from the people	negative	hillary	
I actually find it funny that a ton of the people in the middle are for Clinton. But the outsides are for Bernie. This is a perfect analogy for the race. They didn't really show the crowd, it sure sounded to be very pro Bernie. 	positive	bernie	
Bernie's performance tonight, combined with the impassioned crowd, is exactly why Hillary didn't want more debates. 	negative	hillary	
If she carries NY, she'll probably shut down any more Democratic debates: it just looked bad for her.	negative	hillary	
If you look at the most recent Gallup poll Hillary is losing energy at a proportional rate to Bernie's energy gain.She could very well soon become another low energy candidate	negative	hillary	
That was one of the best moments of the campaign so far. Almost as inspiring as his famous "can be" speech. Bring the win home for Bernie, New Yorkers.Phonebank, canvass, donate, and phonebank some more!	positive	bernie	
the look on his opponent's face says something along the lines of "that's nice, but my backers own the entire system and they'll get what they want, it's quaint that you little poor people think this way but it won't matter for me". That's my interpretation of her facial expression and demeanor while Bernie is getting deafening applause and chanting.I also don't trust any of these polls or election results that say "51/49". It's just the same vote rigging and fraud that has been used in elections since Gore  v. Bush - just ask a computer programmer for the electronic voting machines who testifies under oath before officials that he was ordered to write code that would flip the votes 51/49, ['*to make it look believable*'.] He says he did this in a way that would be untraceable, and he was ordered to provide this code for a previous election, and that it would then be used on the central tabulation machines (and in that way it wouldn't be necessary to access every voting machine - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eER3oha8q2U)I hope you guys don't delete this because it's factual and I'm worried that it needs to be said, related to the issue going to the supreme court (and being ignored when it got there), and it's speculation we may all need to deal with based on modern historical facts, not "a theory". Don't trust the polls. We already know we can't universally trust the parties and voter registry or polling officials, don't blindly trust anything else either. ESPECIALLY anything that says they are neck and neck, they obviously aren't based on all the other available facts. If they try this, they will get away with it unless people like you guys try to hold them to account legally.what HRC has is billionaire global finance-mafia backers, those people have in fact lied our entire civilization into numerous wars, they send funds/arms and training to literal violent muslim fundamentalists and head-chopper regimes like Saudi Arabia, and they've defrauded everyone in the stock markets to such an extent that we've almost seen a global financial collapse and half of the west is forced into living in "austerity". Let's not pretend they aren't capable of fraud, because observing the modern facts says they are; those types are HRC's biggest "donors".When the occupy wall street protests happened, they moved from soft-authoritarian to direct authoritarian and sent their police out to torture students with electrical current and noxious gasses. If the rich are willing to send cops to gas, beat, cage, and electrocute students at colleges, they are willing to be dishonest in elections, and I'm sure that billions worth of resources buys quite a lot of influence at polling organizations. No one wants to think we're in this position, but we are. The very rich people are in the position they are specifically because they're good at "pulling a fast one" on people. I get the distinct impression they're trying to do that now, especially with this "oh look how neck and neck the candidates are" "we swear". It's a scam/sham.	negative	hillary	
yeah, that look on her face was 100% "That's cute, but I already know I'm winning this"	negative	hillary	
"Fuck" -Hillary	negative	hillary	
When he finished i raised my arms in the air in victory!  That was the most glorious 2 minutes of speech i've heard in a long time!!!	positive	bernie	
Man.. his passion just makes me tingle.  I wouldn't take a bullet for many, but if he get's into the white house, I would consider it if it meant protecting him and our future.  This man is everything that is right in the world of politics.	positive	bernie	
Meanwhile Hillary's closing remark consists of a bit on breaking down economic, racial, gender, and homophobic barriers.You know, that shit Bernie's been doing for decades.Then she follows up with some 9/11 fluff about firefighters. What a lame followup to Bernie's closing address.	negative	hillary	
Super pathetic, but look in comments on her supporters "She knocked it out of the park". Scary world we live in.	negative	hillary	
Scary that MSM and her supporters are saying she won the debate. Oh yeah.. msm is her supporters. 	negative	hillary	
I don't know what the future holds. But for any politician that ever had aspirations of running for the biggest office in the land, there are not many things that are more amazing that standing on a stage in New York with a room full of people chanting your name.That would satisfy just about any regular person. That memory is a keeper. Fortunately, Bernie knows he still has work to do.	positive	bernie	
this man gets me in tears and i'm not even from the US. we got most of what he is speaking already here in Germany, but it's still exciting how much passion he puts in to get you guys back on track. 	positive	bernie	
I just don't get it. I can't get past her insincerity. I wouldn't say I read people particularly well, but it's just so god damn obvious. I have to accept that the majority of her supporters have never seen or heard a word she has said. 	negative	hillary	
they know.  they openly know.  they accept it as part of the deal.  Hillary supporters arent dumb.  I just want more- I dont want to accept that stuff as part of the deal.  I never really had that option before Bernie.	negative	hillary	
Hillary: Plz...clap...	negative	hillary	
From our family room too, my husband was "go Bernie! He'll win, this is it" and I was raising my arms to the air "yes! this is why I phonebank for you!" it reminded me of his "can be" speech, and I was especially glad he expertly worded the money in politics issue. New Yorkers have been awesome on the phone, quick, curious, conversational, interested, wish there were more days to call ny before Tuesday. Let's do this people.	positive	bernie	
Chants and cheers of a dream!Scotland loves you, Bernie!	positive	bernie	
I love the look on Hillary's face when they are chanting; *"BERNIE, BERNIE, BERNIE"* I bet she only dreams about having a support base like that.	negative	hillary	
That chant at the end was amazing! Wow! It was a full house of Bernie supporters. 	positive	bernie	
Damn, as a Dutch citizen, I feel the Bern.	positive	bernie	
Oh lol, Shillarys face at the end during the Bernie chants ... priceless. 	negative	hillary	
Finally, someone that doesn't care for money, has no special interest, the most honest candidate I've ever seen. America needs you bernie, bring it home to new york!	positive	bernie	
He may have started off a bit slow but when he picked up steam and especially considering the horseshit time disparity, what he did last night what truly truly inspiring 	positive	bernie
