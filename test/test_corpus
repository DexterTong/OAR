As a Bernie supporter, I mostly agree with Krugman. Bernie's campaign is starting to get ugly as it becomes more obvious he can't win, and this is counterproductive. Bernie has always been a long shot, and instead of being sore losers, we should focus on the positive: Bernie's unexpectedly high levels of success have given a new legitimacy to left-wing positions that were considered far outside the mainstream just a year ago. There's a real chance to start a movement here, complete with Congressional candidates. Not for 2016, but in 4 or 8 years, who knows?	negative	
Bernie's campaign is punk rock. And I adore punk rock.  But I mean if we're playing Radiohead I'm definitely fine with Radiohead.	positive	b

As someone who has not voted democrat for over 30 years (I have voted libertarian) I would vote for Sanders. He seems genuine and honest. He reminds me of Jimmy Carter.I have spent a lot of time in Washington lately working on legislation for Cybersecurity (trying to get a law passed to make big software companies be more transparent about their vulnerabilities to customers) and realize how corrupt Washington is and how much power money has over politicians, who admit it to my face. Sanders would be fighting a huge uphill battle. I have to admire someone who obviously knows that and is still willing to take the beating. It gives me a little hope. 	positive	bernie	
to take it even a step further, realize the tenor of how a sanders presidency would have come to pass. There are millions of individuals who sanders answers to, rather than corporations. As his job is to serve and defend the people he represents, he could leverage this strength to ensure that his policies successfully proceed. In the event that someone obstructs, he can vocalize this chagrin and that representative will suddenly have millions of angry people chomping at the bit to kick him/her out of office :)	positive

She actually knew her topics and could explain them. Competent.  Maybe if someone spent more time on defrenestration of banks and less on marxist theory speeches for pontifical conferences...	negative	bernie
My biggest problem with Sanders over the whole night was with the energy discussion.  It seemed like he was just hitting Hillary over and over with the incrementalism == bad comments (incrementalism isn't enough, never incrementalism when it comes to global warming,  imminent threat that has to be responded to immediately rather than incrementally) but then when pressed on the point that his proposals to end nuclear and natural gas would result in more coal usage to meet energy demands, he came out with "Well, you don't just switch everything overnight."  It made me much more confident in my assumption that he has nothing beyond talking points when it comes to meeting energy demands in an environmentally sustainable way.  	negative	
I think you're seeing something that isn't there. I'm pretty liberal. And when Bernie started picking up steam, I didn't care. I just thought to myself, who cares if either of them win, it's all good. But then Sander's supporters started going crazier and crazier, attacking Hillary. And now, Sanders himself had started repeating crazy things. Sanders read a title to an article. Assumed it was a direct quote, and without any context of the interview, slams Hillary for being unqualified to be president. Not for a little bit either, he kept going on about it, laying out a line by line reasoning of why she isn't qualified.Thats what Krugman is talking about when he says "good and bad behavior." You can't keep slamming the shit out of your own team. Yes, Sanders and Clinton are competing right now. But They are ultimately on the same team. Blowing things out of proportion, choosing facts without context, and repeatedly alluding to negative character attacks against Clinton's integrity, is why Krugman is saying what he did. yea, Sanders campaign, and his supporters, do need guidelines. It's fun in a campaign to diss the opponent, but you have to remember the kind of rhetoric and thought process that has for the future of this country. In this way, its too late for Sanders to walk back what has happened. He has encouraged a lot of voters to always believe passionate speeches over criticizing analysis. Those are the voters that will continue to look for what sounds good, instead of what is based on good analytics. This is what Krugman is referring to when he says, what's good for the campaign is isn't good for America. Sanders might build up for passion, and frenzy, with these statements. But it isn't good for America. Its not incredibily condescending. Its criticism. Very valid ones too. I'm glad people like him and others hit Sanders hard for his comments of late. Because it seems he's starting to walk back from it. http://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2016-election/evolution-clinton-sanders-feud-over-qualifications-n553046Hopefully he drops all of this negative bullshit he's been building up. 	negative	
I studied everything I could for two weeks before the final round of interviews, and I got the job with a sweet starting offer after 8 hours of questioning and presenting. Bernie just reminds me of everyone I know who half asses everything important while riding off their personal brand.	negative	bernie	
I definitely notice some similarities in your descriptions and his rhetoric. No doubt about it. As someone who was excited when Sanders declared his presidency, I quickly backed away from his good-vs-evil hardline rhetoric. 	positive	
I have never heard any Sanders supporter clarify exactly how breaking up the big banks benefits society, nor heard any of them accurately assess the potential downfalls of doing so.  It's literally just emotional fervor.  It's amusing to me that this type of behaviour is coming mostly from college students, and not the uneducated.  Says a lot about modern education, really. 	negative	
I hope so. I really agree with Sanders' positions in a lot of ways as a socialist* myself and it's disappointing that someone like him has such an uphill battle. It remains to be seen how far he can go without getting dirty.*^^^alright, ^^^democratic ^^^socialist. 	positive	bernie	
See, I was never a Sanders supporter - maybe a sympathizer? He makes some really good points and has some great ideas. It always felt odd to cheer his losses; it was more like I wanted both of them to win.   What this primary season has shown more than anything is how broken and antiquated our electoral system is. First-past-the-post voting instead of some form of runoff, for starters - all the way to how we disenfranchise voters through a murky, patched together system laced with gerrymandering, inconsistency, and poor implementation. THAT is what I would like to see change by 2020, because it benefits everyone.   Considering we'll likely have a republican controlled congress along with 40 republican state legislatures and governors until then, it might be all we *can* do. 	positive	b
She knocked it out of the park, as expected. I'm really looking forward to seeing what she can accomplish from the White House.	positive	hillary	
Hopefully more attention will be given to it. I'm a Bernie supporter, but I've been a bit hesitant on the idea of jumping to a $15/hr minimum wage relatively quickly (compared to the history of wage raises). Hillary's $12/hr with encouragement to go above and beyond absolutely sounds more achievable and I imagine would set the groundwork for more timely, appropriate changes moving alongside inflation in the future.	positive	
According to the video they've got on SFP about it right now, he wants to dissolve the FSOC and give unilateral power to the Treasury Secretary to execute banks. I guess the idea is that this avoids regulatory capture of the FSOC, and brings us into a world where Bernie's Secretary is King of Wall Street.	negative

Some of his answers were still cringeworthy.  Especially on Libya.>I voted to support democracy in Libya.  Ok great>That didn't mean I was for regime change.When you voted that the US should go to the UN to advocate democracy in Libya did you think that plan included leaving a genocidal dictator in charge?  How can you vote for democracy and then criticize Hillary/Obama for actually taking the steps to try to implement democracy?You either support letting them have democracy or you oppose regime change.  You can't have both.  Democracy means removing the regime, and leaving the regime in place means no democracy.	negative	
About half my Bernie supporter friends have come around. The other half is still sending me anti-Hillary FB posts and Bernie or Bust diatribes. I'm working on staying positive and not responding. There's too much at stake - Supreme Court, the Senate, Cook now has 20 House Seats ready to flip and tons of local races that we need to win. Hope they don't take till Sept to get over their grief. We need to work hard on this election.	positive	h
Most of my donations are still going to Sanders, but this is a big deal, and I'm happy to put my money where my mouth is.  Hopefully, an uptick in donations post-endorsement will convince other politicians on the fence to follow suit, and prove that campaign crowdfunding is not a fluke.	positive

I loved that moment. And then when Clinton said "she" talking about the federal judge struck me as so oddly specific.

This interview was very good for Hillary. I don't know how someone is so knowledgeable about every aspect of most issues. Nuance answers don't explain this women, she is her very own policy advisor. Usually most politicians, including cerebral people like Obama, need in-depth briefings on both domestic and foreign policy, but from what I've read from her policy advisors she knows about as much as them and asks really esoteric questions. Maybe she should copy Trump by saying she's her best advisor because she has a "good brain." Edit: use of scary was confusing	positive	hillary	
Sanders sounded competent on foreign policy, as compared to previous debates where I literally cringed during his foreign policy answers.	positive

>That's one of two stories that WaPo wrote on the matter. His plan is basically ask the oversight panel (chaired by the Sec of Treasury) to more aggressively choose "significant" banks and push legislation that forces them to downsize themselves.The problem with this is it still doesn't dive into *how* you downsize the banks. If the bank is one size and shrinks to another, where do the parts that once were, go to? 	negative	bernie

Well in my opinion the next President, whether they are a centrist like Kasich or Clinton or more extreme like Trump or Sanders is going to have one hell of a time trying to get anything passed. There is no way Bernie would get anything passed at all. 	negative	bernie	
I love this quote in the article: >"From her time advocating for children as a young lawyer to her work as first lady of Arkansas and the United States, and as a senator and secretary of state, Hillary Clinton has a remarkable record. She would be a strong and capable president.>>But Bernie Sanders is boldly and fiercely addressing the biggest challenges facing our country."He doesn't put Clinton down, but instead pushes Bernie up. He goes on to explain why Bernie's vision will lead America into a prosperous future. I think this idea is something that we all need to remember and take stock of. I know we all tend to get very into campaigning and the craziness that surrounds us (regardless of who or what creates that energy) but we need to remember that change doesn't happen when others are pushed down, but when we are able to lift each other up. #FeelTheLoveEdit: Thanks for all the upvotes guys! Now I have a warm feeling in my tummy. 😊	positive	
I think Bernie's career-long "outsider" status has hurt him in a way. Hillary has been in the thick of the nitty gritty stuff while Bernie has had the luxury, as an independent, to fight for idealistic things. He's never really had to defend his major policy ideas because until this past year, no one questioned him on it. He just kind of plodded along in Congress where generalities and broad approaches to topics can get you a passing grade in a friendly home state. He did himself a disservice by not nailing down the real world specifics knowing he'd be up against a policy wonk like Clinton. edit: spelling	negative	bernie	
Bernie shouldn't be allowed to dictate the platform, but that doesn't mean his ideas should be ignored. Those 40% should get their chance to speak and if their positions have majority support they should be included in the platform. He's asking for the makeup of the committees to reflect the makeup of the Democratic Party, which doesn't sound too unreasonable to me.	positive	
Meanwhile Hillary's closing remark consists of a bit on breaking down economic, racial, gender, and homophobic barriers.You know, that shit Bernie's been doing for decades.Then she follows up with some 9/11 fluff about firefighters. What a lame followup to Bernie's closing address.	negative	hillary	
Didnt you hear, Hillary is doing so so well, she's def gunna win!  You can tell because she's grasping at straws and chasing shadows.	negative	hillary	
I think overall I was impressed with how Hillary went after Bernie on his inconsistencies. When Bernie was asked to give an example of one decision that Hillary made as senator that showed she favored banks because of the money she received, he didn't give anything that was close to an answer. It was one of the weakest responses of the night. And while I agree with Bernie that the banks should be broken up, I don't think attacking Hillary is the way to wake America up on this issue. What he should be saying is that super-PACs and money from Wall Street is corruptible to ALL. Whether or not Hillary is guilty of taking money from Wall Street in exchange for favors is irrelevant. Because not only has he been unable to prove that it's influenced her policy-making, but it's also  distracting the voters to what the real issue is. Everybody has become so anti-Hillary, they've made her the single root of all corruption. But it's just speculation and assumption over facts. We should be taking on the system, not one single individual who may or may not be guilty. Bernie needs to hit on the bigger picture more aggressively: that Super-PACs have opened the floodgates to corruption. So if it hasn't happened to Hillary Clinton, it's going to happen to SOMEBODY. The fact that super-PACs exist damages our democracy. And that's what he should be preaching to America. And I know this is a presidential race, so it's easy for Bernie to make Hillary his punching bag on this issue, but she is just too ferocious of a debater and she proved that last night.	negative	
Yeah, I disagree with plenty of Krugman's analysis (Hurricane Sandy being good for the economy as an example), but I have a hard time disagreeing with his criticisms of Sanders. I think Krugman is talking to a wall right now. The people that he is directing this article at aren't going to listen. The people that will listen have likely been listening for months. When you set a narrative of being anti-establishment, you can just ignore people like Krugman under the guise of them being the establishment. 	negative	
You can't have your cake and eat it too. Bernie Sanders has lost the nomination but spent the past month talking about how it will be a contested convention and that they're going to try and make a floor fight out of it. You can't threaten to go to war with someone and then get offended when they start building walls. If he wanted influence on these things it was available to him. In fact, it's probably still available to him. He can negotiate with Clinton and drop out in return for X, Y, and Z. If he continues then he'll get a speech at 4am on Tuesday and a gold plaque thanking him for his service. 	negative	
That's one thing that bugs me. They keep talking about gun manufacturers being the only businesses that have "special protections." but that's not the case at all. Clinton even asked "show me one other business that has this kind of protection."It's not a special protection given only to gun manufacturers, it's actually the opposite. It's that they want to be able to sue the gun manufacturers for something that no other manufacturers are held liable for - misuse of a product.There isn't a company in the US that can be sued for accident or injury caused by misuse of the product, only for manufacturing or design defects in the product itself.It's why you can't sue Ford when you are hit by a drunk driver or a knife manufacturer when you accidentally cut your finger off. You can't sue a shampoo producer if you get poisoned from drinking shampoo and you can't sue a baseball bat manufacturer because the mugger that attacked you hit you with it.You can absolutely sue a gun manufacturer if the gun has a defect and explodes or has some other dangerous manufacturing or design flaw.So why should a special liability be applied to gun manufacturers that does not apply to any other manufacturer or industry?edit: Yes, I do understand that you *can* sue since you can pretty much sue for anything, but you can't necessarily *successfully* sue, which was the (I thought implied) intent of my statement to begin with.	positive

The difference between Clinton and Sanders in their interviews is night and day. Sanders' answers suggest that he's totally unprepared (avoiding direct questions by reverting to his stump speech), whereas Clinton has very clearly done her homework and can answer a question without obfuscation. Especially in the realm of foreign policy, Bernie just can't compete with Clinton.Edit: a word	positive	hillary	
Regarding immigration, he wants to get people in the country on the road to citizenship/green card, because people working in this country illegally drives wages down for everyone.  He also wants to seriously curtail the temporary worker program because the workers are often paid a fraction of what a qualified American would earn doing the same job and they can often be taken advantage of in other ways, plus it drives wages down for everyone.  He's for higher wages for everyone so he's against things that get in the way of that.	positive	bernie

I supported Obama, but part of my point was that even he isn't really that close to my own values. Let's be honest; behind the rhetoric he was always a slightly more liberal continuation of the establishment Third Way. I like him, and I love that we managed to elect a black President, but he wasn't a working class candidate. His funding made that clear.As for the rest, that's Bill Clinton twice, Al Gore and John Kerry. Sure, it's a small sample, but that's twenty-five years' worth of candidates, and they've all been much too moderate and business-friendly for me. I understand why -- two-party system, you have to win, all that noise -- but it's tiring to continually be pushed aside. That's the reason so many people are excited about Sanders. We haven't seen anything like him in a long, long time. 	positive

I think this is the right mentality, but I would caution that tone is very important. I don't identify as a Sanders supporter, even though I would vote for him, because I have been so frustrated with the people I know who do identify as zealous Sanders supporters. These are people who post clickbait attacks on Hillary daily, but have dealt with me with hostility and outrage when I mentioned I had problems with Sanders stances on immigration and gun control. If you want to sway people to vote for Sanders, you have to deal with them on their terms and address their concerns about his candidacy. Too many people I know have bought into the reddit circlejerk about him so severely that they're actually a liability to the Sanders campaign because of their toxic tone and the way they deal with disagreement.  	negative	bernie
