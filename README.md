Reddit is (probably) the world's largest internet forum, divided into thousands of subforums (called subreddits) that
cover almost every discussable topic in the English-speaking world. With the 2016 US Presidential election on the way, I
decided to investigate how reddit users on various election-related subreddits feel about the candidates and issues
(foreign policy, healthcare, etc). In narrower terms, I will perform a sentiment analysis on reddit, broken
 down by subreddit, candidate, and issue.

Created as a final project for Natural Language Processing, Spring 2016.
